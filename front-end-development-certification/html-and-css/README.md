My sample code and projects from freeCodeCamp 

https://www.freecodecamp.org/

Front End Web Developer Certification 
* HTML and CSS
	* the examples in this section are pretty basic 
	* there are provided here more for "completeness"
	* Each challenge tends to build simply on the work of the prevous one
	* some exmples contain code that was copied from freeCodeCamp.org as a starting point
	* this should be noted in the comments in the files
